## Overview  


- Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) prevalence: ~ 3% [@rana2021prevalence]  
- Women are 85% to 90% of cases  [@kim2013clinical]
- Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified variants that associate with FMD [@georges2021genetic]  
- Two-Sample Mendelian Randomization (MR) uses GWAS results to estimate a causal effect, subject to assumptions  


## FMD 

- FMD affects artery walls  
- Diagnosed with angiography, but may be overlooked in clinical practice    
- Prevalence (U.S.A.): ~ 3%   
- Women are 85% to 90% of cases

## Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)

- About one in ten people have CKD  
- Affected ~ 16% of Americans aged 20+ in 1999 to 2004  
- Causes and prevalences differ by ancestry  
- Genome-wide association studies have revealed some genetic variants that affect CKD  



## FMD & CKD  

- FMD is the second-most common abnormality of renal arteries [@van2018renal]  
- FMD prevalence among potential kidney donors: 2% to 6% 


## Mendelian Randomization: Big Picture

- Major goal of biomedical research is to identify causes of diseases  
- Randomized controlled trials are a *gold standard* for causal conclusions  
- Confounding plagues observational studies that seek causal inferences  
- Germline genotypes are randomly assigned at meiosis  
- MR as "Nature's randomized controlled trial"  




## Mendelian Randomization: A Method for Assessing Causal Relationships 

**Three Key Assumptions**:

1. SNP instruments associate with Exposure  
1. No common causes of SNPs and Outcome  
1. No Exposure-independent path between SNPs and Outcome  

- FMD is Exposure  
- CKD is Outcome

## FMD & CKD: MR Inputs    


- Need GWAS Summary Statistics for FMD & CKD (with no subject overlap)
- FMD GWAS summary statistics [@georges2021genetic]   
- UK Biobank CKD GWAS summary statistics (women only) [@neale-gwas]   
- Choose a set of SNPs based on associations with FMD (p-value threshold: $10^{-8}$)  


## FMD & CKD: Results

## FMD & CKD: Results 

| Method | slope | se | pvalue |  
| ------ | ----- | -- | ------ |
| MR Egger | 0.003 | 0.002 | 0.38 |
| Weighted Median | 0.0002 | 0.0002 | 0.54 |
| Inverse Variance Weighted | - 0.0001 | 0.0004 | 0.77 |
| Simple Mode | 0.0002 | 0.0003 | 0.60 |
| Weighted Mode | 0.0002 | 0.0003 | 0.50 | 


- *Statistical power is presumably weak here*




## Summary & Next Steps  


- No evidence of causal relationship between FMD and CKD (but statistical power!)  
- Further sensitivity analyses are needed to quantify effects of possible biases   
- Consider other sets of SNPs with different p-value thresholds
